# Zero-G Drill Game and Astronaut Security

The Name of our project is Zero G Drill Game and Astronaut's Security.
We are making Drill games for the Astronauts..
Here we using drill type games here because,
this drill will teach them to operate smoothly in tense situation and it will help them for recreation as well.
We are also making sure that all the astronauts stay safe while playing this Drill games.
we have made a security system for this game as well. This game can be played inside ISS or Shuttle,
It can Also be played outside of ISS.
We are using RFI Sensor to range the area,
where the astronauts will operate their drill games.
The astronauts will be tagged with Radio Tagging frequency tracker to mark their position.
If the astronauts gets drift away from   the ranged area....
The the alarm will be triggered automatically and it will activate the Electromagnetic field and pull the astronauts inside the inside the safe zone again.
In this way we can prevent the astronauts from drifting away....
